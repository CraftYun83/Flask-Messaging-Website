# Flask-Messaging-Website
Messaging extension of my flask template website.

Includes all the features my flask template website has, but with a messaging feature.

Allows users to message each other with ease. Requires a redis server. If your server is not hosted on port 6379, change the main.py file accordingly.

Credits are the same as my Flask Template Website.
